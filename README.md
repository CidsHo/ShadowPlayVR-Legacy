# ShadowPlayVR (Legacy Version)
This is the original version of ShadowPlayVR system (Dev based on HTC VIVE). I developed this system for my master thesis and some other papers.
As I have moved to Quest3, I am currently converting this project into new platform. This project is just for demonstration and documentation.
