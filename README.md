# ShadowPlayVR (Legacy Version)
This is the original version of the ShadowPlayVR system, developed on the HTC VIVE for my master's thesis and other papers. As I have transitioned to Quest3, I am currently porting this project to the new platform. This project is intended solely for demonstration and documentation purposes.
